# Knapsack-EA-iCog-task
This repository contains the implementation of the Knapsack Problem using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Developed as part of my AI research internship at iCog Labs, the project demonstrates the application of optimization techniques inspired by natural selection to solve complex combinatorial problems.
